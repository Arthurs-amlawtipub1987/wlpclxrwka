Okay, so I just staggered out of the theater, and holy moley, what on Earth did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? The Ballad of Wallis Island… it’s like, you've got a blender. You throw in a bunch of colors, feelings, maybe an old shoe, and then just hit liquify. The  ’s not easy to pin down. I mean, part of me is vibing with this confused raggedy puzzle. But another part? Low-key wants to strangle it for being so mind-numbingly nothing at points.

I guess the main thing is the colors. God, those blasted colors. Everywhere. Pastels washed out like a bad Instagram filter but somehow also lush? It was like stepping into someone else's dream—and you know when you're trying to remember a dream and everything’s a blur but it kinda works, like some genius toddler made it. I’m going to be seeing those hues when I close my eyes tonight. Or, more likely, when I try to sleep but just end up staring at the ceiling existentially pondering Wallis freakin’ Island.

And hey, what was that scene with the lobster tank? Why must indie 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 insist on these out-of-left-field scenes that make you question your whole existence? Was it symbolic? Was it a plot point? Or just there to make sure you don’t start playing with your phone? Speaking of—I'd almost be tempted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to scrub back to that moment. You know, when I’m less fried and questioning all my life decisions.

> The protagonist—or was there one?—felt like the guy you know from college who always had theories about everything but never actually did anything. Asking what’s it all mean, man? every five minutes. You’re like, dude, dial it back a notch, there’s only so much contemplation one's brain can handle without a hard reboot.

And oh! Let’s not forget the seagull. What was his deal? Just flying around like a motionless soggy paper airplane. But hey, that soundtrack? I'm weirdly obsessed. It’s like it got scooped out from between the lines of an unread book next to a rain-streaked window. I think it was meant to make me feel something—mission accomplished?

But all this jumble that shouldn’t mix together somehow does. It’s like those dishes made with peanut butter and who-knows-what that flavor bomb your tongue to oblivion. You can’t say if it's genius or just weird, but the brain squirrels are definitely amused.

```csharp
int seagullFlightPattern = 0;
while(seagullIsFlying){
    seagullFlightPattern++;
}
```

Honestly, should you go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  —straight-up I'm mixed. I mean, it's a sensory trip no doubt. If you're looking to give your brain a workout it didn’t sign up for—Wallis Island, baby, is the jam. But seriously take a friend, because when your head’s swimming in circles, at least you'll have backup to figure out if you saw what you think you saw.
